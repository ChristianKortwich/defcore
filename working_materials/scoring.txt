DefCore Scoring Worksheet
=========================

This file is used to maintain capabilities scoring for DefCore.
It is considered "working materials" under the 2015B process and
is not an authoritative, Board-approved source of information
as to which capabilities are required for a particular Guideline.
Rather, it is a point-in-time listing used by DefCore Committee
members while determining which capabilities may be included in
a future Guideline.  Each line takes the following form:

Capability Name: [Widely Deployed,Used By Tools,Used by Clients],
                 [TC Future Direction, Complete, Stable],
                 [Discoverable, Doc'd, Core in Last Release],
                 [Foundational, Atomic, Proximity],
                 [Non-Admin]

Possible scores: 0, 1, ? (not scored yet or needs discussion)
