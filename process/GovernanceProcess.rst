Governance Process
==================

* Meetings will be interactive using Google Hangouts (we will already
    stream for non-committee members)

* Members are expected to to their homework. We will not be rehashing
    due to time limits.

* Meetings will work from resolutions that are proposed in advance with
  +/- voting (cochairs are +/-2) 

  - As per Board of Directors policy we welcome broad engagement but
    cannot allow proxies on resolutions

  - resolution +/- could be asserted before the meeting (but may have
    to be overruled based on discussion)
